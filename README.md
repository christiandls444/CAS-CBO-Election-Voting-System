# CAS CBO Election Voting System
Final Project in Software Engineering for CAS CBO, Oct 2020 - Feb 2021
<br>
<br>
The College of Art and Science (C.A.S.) has an organization called College Based Organization (C.B.O.) on each course annually voting for change the term from the president down to the college level representative and open for new candidates that will manage the college organization. Voting in our College traditionally counts manually from the ballot box that sometimes leads to the mistake of counting and probably cheating of the election winners that can result from disobedience. This research aims to develop a software application for College Based Organization (C.B.O.) to have an Automated Voting System that can help efficiency and security of the votes that can lead to an accurate result of the election.
